# CleanCV :sparkles: :page_facing_up: : Modern, minimal, and modular LaTeX CV template

Most academic LaTeX CVs are ugly, hard to use, or both. CleanCV gives you clean design, effortless customization, and advanced features — so you can focus on your research, not formatting.

2. **Edit your files:**
   - **Locally:** Clone and edit with any LaTeX editor
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-cv-repo.git
     # Edit main.tex and publications.bib, then compile
     ```
   - **Overleaf:** Edit in Overleaf by syncing your Github repo to Overleaf [(guide)](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/GitHub_Synchronization) (premium required)
